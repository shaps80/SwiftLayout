--- 

Often we have to use AutoLayout in our apps. In fact sometimes, we can't even use Interface Builder. Which means we need to add these programmatically.

I had previously done this manually, even occassionally used a 3rd party lib/pod. There are some great libs out there, but I wanted to build my own. Both for my own understanding and also to provide a cleaner interface that made programmatic AutoLayout easy.

_Introducing SwiftLayout_

```swift
import SwiftLayout

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      
      let views = [ addView(), addView(), addView() ]

      UIView.distribute(views, inView: view, alongAxis: .Vertical)
      UIView.size(width: 100, height: 50, ofViews: views)
      UIView.alignHorizontally(ofViews: views, toView: view)

      let label = UILabel()
      view.addSubview(label)
      label.pin(.Left, toEdge: .Right, toView: view, margin: 15)
    }
  
}
```
